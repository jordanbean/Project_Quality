# Project_Quality
Analyzing the change in quality of MLB play using rookie demographics and team performance.

The goal of this project was to follow-up on the analysis for temperature and attendance per game to identify other potentially 
correlating factors to MLB's attendance issue.

In this analysis, we use player data from www.thebaseballcube.com and final standings data from www.baseball-reference.com
to create a set of analyses that explores changes in time series data. Other information was obtained from
wikipedia and retrosheet.org.

The findings are largely a result of exploratory data analysis rather than statistical significance testing or modeling,
which were included in prior analyses.
